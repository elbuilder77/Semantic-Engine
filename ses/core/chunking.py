"""
Chunking module for SES document ingestion.

Splits large text into overlapping chunks suitable for embedding models
with limited context windows (e.g. 256-512 tokens). Uses a recursive
strategy that tries to split on natural boundaries first.

    """
    Split *text* into overlapping chunks of roughly *chunk_size* characters.

    The algorithm tries to split on paragraph breaks first (``\\n\\n``), then
    line breaks, sentence endings, and finally spaces.  Each chunk shares
    *chunk_overlap* trailing characters with the next chunk so that context
    is not lost at boundaries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text : str
        The full document text.
    chunk_size : int
        Target maximum length (in characters) for each chunk.
    chunk_overlap : int
        Number of characters to repeat between consecutive chunks.

    Returns
    -------
    list[str]
        Non-empty chunks.  If the input text is shorter than *chunk_size*,
        a single-element list is returned.
